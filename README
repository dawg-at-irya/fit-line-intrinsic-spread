* Fitting a line to data with large intrinsic spread

The script ODR_vs_OVAR.py illustrates the difference in fit quality between Orthogonal Distance Regression (ODR) and
    regression that includes a treatment of intrinsic variance orthogonal to the best-fit line (OVAR). The latter
    treatment is based on the discussion in Section 7/8 of Hogg et al. 2010.

Import ODR_vs_OVAR into python and execute main().

The data used in this example consists of 8 micron excess fluxes for C-rich AGB candidates in the LMC (Srinivasan+ 2009).
